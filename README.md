I am a software engineer, researcher and an aspiring enterpreneur, who enjoys challenging tasks, creating new products and building intelligent applications. Passionate about      diversity in STEM, automation, emerging technologies as well as their social implications. Interested in research about bias in AI, human-computer interaction; using technology to solve issues of climate change. When I am not working on major projects I contribute to open source and dabble in hardware & robotics. Hit me up on LinkedIn or email!
